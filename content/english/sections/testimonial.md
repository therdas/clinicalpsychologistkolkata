    content: "I had been struggling with depression since 2021, as a result of which my academic life was severely hampered. Though I had been under treatment since late 2021, nothing had shown any consistent positive results. In November 2023, I was put in touch with Dr Mitra. Over the next one and a half years, he has been a significant source of support for me, particularly in coordinating between my parents and me, as well as with my psychiatrist. Recovery from mental health conditions is slow and arduous, and in my case, it might not have been possible but for the close supervision I had been under Dr Mitra."

    content: "1. I visited Tanmoy sir at NIBS, when I started failing in graduation even after scoring 93.5% in high school. I was suffering with OCPD and was obsessed with a few stuff that had crippled my life.\n2. I was prescribed CBT with a few meds. I donot know when CBT started, when it ended or if it is still continuing... But what I do know is I made it through graduation, made it to through my masters in my desired college, and made it to a job in one of the sought after MNCs. Nothing in my life is ever happening without him. He came as a professional... Remained as my saviour. And will remain as my light house till I breathe"

    content: "I visited Tanmoy Sir at NIBS at the lowest point of my life, during my bachelor's degree. I was unable to focus on anything and was diagnosed with OCD and Severe Anxiety. From there, with Sir's help, managed to score above 90% and even finished my master's degree first-of-our-batch. Due to his unwavering help, support and kindness, I have been able to acheive many goals in life. Even now, having been diagnosed with chronic pain/fibromyalgia, Sir's help has been invaluable in getting me back to my feet and helping me live my life to the fullest. Many, many thanks to him and I could not imagine acheiving even a fraction of what I have without his help."
